#[Deep Web](#deep-web)

The [Deep Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Web) (also called the Deepnet, Invisible Web,[2] or Hidden Web[3]) is World Wide Web content that is not part of the Surface Web, which is indexed by standard search engines.

#[Silk Road](#silk-road)

[Silk Road](http://goo.gl/p0JFW0) is an online market. It is operated as a Tor hidden service, such that online users are able to browse it anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring. The website launched in February 2011; development had begun six months prior. It is part of the **Deep Web**. Although Silk Road is an underground website,sometimes called the **"Amazon.com of illegal drugs"** or the **"eBay for drugs,"** the site also sells apparel, art, biotic materials, books, collectibles, computer equipment, digital goods, along with dozens of other categories of merchandise.
Buyers and sellers conducted all transactions with **bitcoins** (BTC), a cryptocurrency that provides a certain degree of anonymity.[52] Silk Road held buyers' bitcoins in **escrow** until the order had been received and a hedging mechanism allowed sellers to opt for the value of bitcoins held in escrow to be fixed to their value in US$ at the time of the sale to mitigate against **Bitcoin's volatility**. Any changes in the price of bitcoins during transit were covered by Dread Pirate Roberts.

The **Farmer's Market** was a Tor site similar to Silk Road, but which did not use bitcoins. It has been considered a 'proto-Silk Road' but the use of payment services such as **Paypal** and **Western Union** allowed law enforcement to trace payments and it was subsequently shut down by the FBI in 2012.


[Silk Road Reduced Violence in the Drug Trade, Study Argues](http://www.wired.com/2014/06/silk-road-study/)
>Using a custom web crawler, they scraped Silk Road in September of 2013–just before its shutdown by the FBI–to collect a snapshot of all feedback and review data from the site’s vendor profiles. Those posts provided a catalog of past deals on the site, including their frequency and size. They found that the high average price of those deals, along with other clues, implies a surprisingly large number of Silk Road buyers were not consumers, but dealers buying wholesale.

>That’s a different take than previous studies, which have described Silk Road as an eBay for drugs. Instead, Aldridge and Decary-Hetu say their data shows a vast portion of the Silk Road’s sales were “business-to-business.” That finding moves the market’s role farther up the drug market supply chain than was previously thought, they argue, placing it closer to the cartel-controlled drug producers behind much of the trade’s violence. And since the study argues the traders on both sides of a Silk Road deal were often drug dealers, **the researchers claim Silk Road’s business-to-business deals mean twice as many opportunities for violence were prevented.*

##Apple
[Apple Is Preparing For Alternative Currencies](http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/24409233-piperjaff/2959733-apple-is-preparing-for-alternative-currencies)

>Apple (AAPL), and a short list of companies, stand to benefit from Apple's preparation to enable alternative currencies in it's ecosystem. Allowing consumers to pay for content using a currency they are comfortable with is smart move by Apple.
>The new clause under section 11.17, which was flagged by folks on Twitter like investor Bill Lee today, reads: "Apps may facilitate transmission of approved virtual currencies provided that they do so in compliance with all state and federal laws for the territories in which the app functions."
>This opens the door for apps that transmit crypto-currencies such as bitcoin,** a group of apps previously banned from the Apple App Store.
